        <h1>vA3C Embed Example 001</h1>
        <p>In this example we'll load a single model in a dedicated div, and provide a minimal dat.gui interface.  This example should demonstrate how to embed a 3D model viewer in another web page that has it's own formatting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="clear"></div>
    <div class="grid_12" id="vA3C_viewer">embed viewer here!</div>
    <div class="clear"></div>
    <div class="grid_4">
        <h2>Free and Open Source</h2>
        <p>Yeah, so as you are probably already aware, vA3C is a free and open source 3D model viewer that runs in the browser and can render files that were exported from Revit or Grasshopper using the vA3C exporters for those platforms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid_4">
        <h2>Totally hackable</h2>
        <p>Not much of a hack in this example, but because the code is open it's totally up to you in terms of customization.  Want to pull attributes from a database when an element is selected?  Go for it!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid_4">
        <h2>Embeddable</h2>
        <p>As this example shows, it's relatively straightforward to embed a custom viewer in any webpage.  Just reference the required javascript and css files in your head tag and... (finish this thought once it's fully baked).</p>
